    &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  
    Ronzilla (a.k.a "Ron") is a coworker of ours with a big booming voice who is often on the phone for hours at a time.  He can always be counted on for a gem of a quote ranging from marginally questionable to completely inappropiate. Sometimes he says these things to his fellow team, sometimes it may actually be on the phone with the customers. 
       
  <p class="around">&nbsp; &nbsp;
	  He was dubbed Ronzilla on a business 
	  trip to Japan. As he was walking on the Tokyo sidewalk, a British colleague noticed how he towered over all the little Japanese people. The name Ronzilla stuck, and is often shortened to 
	  just Zilla.

	  Currently there are more than  800 quotes with more being added every day.
