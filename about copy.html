        </br> Ronzilla (a.k.a "Ron") is a coworker of ours with a big booming voice and is often on the phone for hours at a time.  Sometimes he says silly things to us, sometimes it may actually be on the phone with the customers. 

  
  
  <p>
  He was dubbed Ronzilla on a business trip to Japan. As he was walking on the Tokyo sidewalk, a British colleague
  noticed how he towered over all the little Japanese people. The name Ronzilla stuck, and is often shortened to 
  just Zilla.
